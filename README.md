## Usage üíª

By selecting a word, or just by having the cursor over a word; just press `Ctrl + Alt + p` to activate the PokeSearch of the package.

## How it works ‚öôÔ∏è

The package directly interacts with the [Pok√©api](https://pokeapi.co/), by consuming the API searching for info of the selected word. In case the word selected is a Pok√©mon, it will display that Pok√©mon's info. If it is not, it will just say it is not a Pok√©mon.
